# AI Assistant (Text, Image, and PDF Chatbot)

This is a powerful Streamlit-based AI Assistant that allows users to interact with Google Gemini models using text input, images, or PDFs. It supports file uploads (PDFs, JPG/PNG images) and gives AI-powered responses in real time.

## Features

- Chat with Gemini 1.5 Flash (Fast) or Gemini 1.5 Pro (Advanced)
- Upload and chat with PDF files (extracts and summarizes content)
- Upload images and ask questions about them
- Maintains chat history for the current session

## Note on Image Generation

This application currently **does not support AI image generation** because the **Gemini API for image creation requires a paid (billing-enabled) Google Cloud account**.

You can still upload and analyze images using the **vision model**, but **creating images (like DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion) is not possible** unless you integrate a third-party service.
